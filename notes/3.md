# The Scope Chain

Take a look at the following code, but don't run it yet.

<pre>
<code>
console.log('Global Execution Context created...');

function b() {
    console.log('Bs Execution Context created');
    console.log(myVar);
}

function a() {
    console.log('As Execution Context created...');
    var myVar = 2;
    b();
}

var myVar = 1;

a();
console.log('Back to Global Execution Context...');
</code>
</pre>

When we log out myVar, what value do you think will be returned?
from what we know about execution contexts it is not unreasonable to believe that myVar would log out as undefined, after all, myVar is not declared in b()'s execution context, however, you would be wrong. Instead the value is 1, the same value as myVar declared at the global context. 

This occurs through what is known as the scope chain. In this example ther code executes, a variable myVar is created with a value of 1, then a new context is created with myVar holding a value of 2, then a third context is created where myVar is not declared, this is the value we log out. 

As we know variables initialize to an initial value of undefined if they are not set explicitly. As mentioned previously, this may lead you to believe this value should be undefined, however, when we request or manipulate variables in JS, the engine not only looks in the current context for declarations, but the other contexts as well that are within that variables outer environment. In this case our outer environment is the global execution context, therefore when we log out our variable we get the value of the variable declared in the global context, since there is no variable within the current context of the same name declared.

Every execution context has a reference to it's outer environment. This outer environment is known as the lexical environment, lexically function b() sits atop of the global environment, it is not inside another function, it sits at the same level as the myVar variable declared in our global context.

JS cares about the lexical environment when it comes to the outer reference that each execution context gets. If JS cannot find a variable in the current local context, it will look at the outer reference and look for variables there. The value of where the reference points to is defined by where the function sits lexically. 

To review, when your functions are invoked, these contexts are created, if a variable is used but not found in the current context, the reference is checked. The reference is decided by the lexical positioning of the function. The execution stack can become pretty large, in which case the references work down the stack looking for declared variables until it reaches the global context. This chain is what we call the scope chain.

If instead, we have nested functions, the reference of b() becomes the context created by a().

<pre>
<code>
function a() {

    function b() {
        console.log(myVar);
    }

    var myVar = 2;
    b();
}

var myVar = 1;
a();
</code>
</pre>

In this instance we log out the value of 2. When we run this code the parser looks through and assigns memory (as mentioned in previous sections), it then invokes a(), creates a new context, within the context of a() is a delcaration of b(), therefore b() is no longer attached to our global context, it is now a part of the new context a(). Even so, when b() is invoked it creates it's own context, which now has a reference to context a(). This means that when we log out our variable in b() the engine checks for a variable, there is no declaraion is b() so it checks our reference, there is a declaration in a(), therefore that declaration is used and 2 is logged out to the console. So, what if we comment out the myVar declaration in a()? then we will log out the value of 1. As we have a declaration in our global context, the failure to find a declaration in any of the other contexts will result in JS looking for our variable in the global context at the end of the scope chain. Similarly, if we log out myVar in a() without a declaration being present, a() would check it's reference, in this circumstance that is the global context, and find the declaration of myVar = 1, again logging out 1 to the console.

<pre>
<code>
function a() {

    function b() {
        var myVar = 1;
    }
    
    b();
    console.log(myVar);
}

a();
</code>
</pre>

So, what if we invert this example, and log out our variable in a() but declare it in b()? well, we receive an error of myVar is not defined. Since the variable is not declared prior to the calling of console.log() no variable exists within the scope of a(). The engine would check a() for a declared variable and find nothing, then it would check a()'s reference to the global context and again find nothing producing the error:

<pre>
<code>
    app.js:8 Uncaught ReferenceError: myVar is not defined
</code>
</pre>

This is because the lexical position of b() is within a(), therefore it is out of a()'s scope as a has no reference to the context created by b(). If we were to switch the log and the declaration back around such that the variable is declared in a() but logged in b() we would receive an output of 1 as b() sits lexically within a() it has a reference to a()'s context.

Declaring b() within a() also means we can no longer just call b() in the global context, because, as we have ascertained, b() sits lexically within a(), therefore it's environment is different. If we call b() from a global context now, the engine will look fora function named b() which does not exist within it's variable environment. And since we are at a global level, there is no reference to check elsewhere as we are as far down in the chain as we can go. When the global execution environment created the global execution context, it found function a() and created a space in memory for it, but it didn't look inside a(), an will not until a() is invoked. Therefore b() does not exist in the global context and is not accessible from the global context. 

Now when we invoke a() a new context is created, at which point the engine sees our declaration of b() adding it to the context. We can then invoke b() inside of a(), which returns a value of 2 since b() checks it's reference and finds myVar in a() at which point it stops. If this declaration was to be commented out we would receive an output of 1 due to the scope chain reaching the global context.
