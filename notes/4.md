# ES6 Scope

Scope is where a variable is accessible within your code, and whether or not it is truly the same variable or a new copy. ES6 adds a new keyword for declaraing variables 'let'. While it is not replacing var it offers a new form of scoping known as block-level scoping. 

In using let you declare a variable in the same way you would do with var:
<pre>
<code>
    let var = 2;
</code>
</pre>

During the execution phase this variable is still placed into memory and set to undefined, however, JS will not allow you to use it until the line of code which declares the variable is actually run during the execution phase.

Furthermore, when we declare variables using let, it is declared inside a block and only accessible inside of that block (a block being defined by curly braces).

<pre>
<code>
    if (a && b) {
        let c = true;
    }
</code>
</pre>

This brings JS inline with other programming languages which already use block-scoping.
