# Variable Environments

If we have the following code:

<pre>
<code>
        function b() {
            var myVar;
        }

        function a() {
            var myVar = 2;
            b();
        }

        var myVar = 1;
        a();
</code>
</pre>

what is the value of myVar at any given time?
To answer this question you must consider the Execution Contexts once again.

So, what happens first? 

The Global Execution Context is created, placing the myVar at the bottom of the script into memory space, in the case of the Global Execution Context, it's variable environment is the global (window) object. The code is then executed, once the engine hits myVar = 1 the current myVar variable stored in memory is assigned a value of 1.

Next, it hits the invocation of a(), creating a new Execution Context. When this happens the myVar declared within a() is placed into this new Execution Contexts variable environment, and is assigned a value of 2 during the execution phase when the line myVar = 2 is run.

Then b() is invoked, creating another new Execution Context, again with it's own variable environment and memory space. Since myVar within b() is not set to a value, the variable will be saved to memory with a value of undefined.

This is to do with a concept known as scope, which is "where are we able to see the variable?". Each variable we are looking at is defined within it's own execution context because it is within a function, and everytime a function is called a new Execution Context is created for that function.

Even though myVar is declared three times, each one is distinct and unique due to being separated by their execution context. In other words they exist within their own scope and are therefore different variables even though they have the same name.

To see how this works, try loggined out each line:

<pre>
<code>
console.log('Global Execution Context created...');

function b() {
    console.log('Bs Execution Context created...');
    var myVar;
    console.log(myVar);
}

function a() {
    console.log('As Execution Context created...');
    var myVar = 2;
    console.log(myVar);
    b();
}

var myVar = 1;
console.log(myVar);

a();

console.log('Back to Global Execution Context...');
console.log(myVar);
</code>
</pre>
